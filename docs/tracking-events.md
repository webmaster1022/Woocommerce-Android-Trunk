# Tracking Events

To add a new event, the event name has to be added as an `enum` in the [`AnalyticsTracker`](../WooCommerce/src/main/kotlin/com/woocommerce/android/analytics/AnalyticsTracker.kt). Tracking the event looks like this:

```kotlin
class OrderDetailViewModel {
    fun onRefreshRequested() {
        AnalyticsTracker.track(Stat.ORDER_DETAIL_PULLED_TO_REFRESH)
    }
}
```

Having the values in the `AnalyticsTracker` enum helps us with comparing the events being tracked in WooCommerce iOS.

## Custom Properties

If the event has custom properties, tracking the event would now look like this:

```kotlin
class OrderDetailViewModel {
    fun onRefreshRequested() {
        AnalyticsTracker.track(
            PRODUCT_IMAGE_UPLOAD_FAILED,
                 mapOf(
                      AnalyticsTracker.KEY_ERROR_CONTEXT to this::class.java.simpleName,
                      AnalyticsTracker.KEY_ERROR_TYPE to event.error?.type?.toString(),
                      AnalyticsTracker.KEY_ERROR_DESC to event.error?.message
                 )
            )
    }
}
```
